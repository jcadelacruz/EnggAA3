      <p>Gym: Housing an olympic-sized pool, indoor basketball court, music room, dance room, clinic, and also a stage which serves as a back-up auditorium, the gymnasium is an all rounder building. The clinic is close to the sports area where injuries are more likely to happen, allowing for quick response time. The volleyball court has been fenced off, while the basketball court is located in an open area. 

The swimming pool is inside the gym complex to take advantage of its covered design. Keeping the pool indoors protects it from external elements allowing for year-round use without the burden of frequent cleaning or weather-related cancellations. In addition, the indoor setting ensures better maintenance of water temperature and cleanliness, supporting both physical education and extracurricular activities effectively.

The clinic is located near the athletic and sports areas, recognizing that injuries are most likely to occur in physically active zones like the gym, courts, and field. By placing the clinic close to where accidents are more probable, we can ensure faster response times and easier access to first aid or emergency care. This enhances the overall safety infrastructure of the school and supports student wellness on a daily basis.

Parking (Gym): Parking has been provided near the gym to make it easy for staff, coaches, and visitors to access the facility directly. This lot also acts as a convenient overflow option during peak hours or special events when the main parking lots are full. Its close proximity to the gym ensures that people can load equipment, bring in materials for events, or simply access the building more easily without disrupting other parts of the campus.

Courts: <moved to gym> This positioning gives each sport its own breathing space and avoids crowding, making the space more comfortable and functional. Both courts are located near the clinic and within the broader sports zone, supporting a smart layout that centralizes active areas for convenience and safety.

Field: The field has been placed close to the perimeter fence allowing for easy access and partial visibility from outside, which is helpful for community use, weekend events, or inter-school matches. Its placement keeps it accessible without interfering with academic or quieter zones of the school. The field also enjoys a broad view of the campus, making it a visually prominent feature. 

Announcement grandstand near clinic: Provides shelter when it rains and can also be a place where people meet up. Allows for announcements to be heard throughout the field whenever there is a general assembly or similar.

Multiple scattered gazebos: We’ve installed several small gazebos scattered around the field. These serve as designated rest spots for students and guests who want to relax after physical exertion or just enjoy the outdoors. The gazebos offer a shaded space that promotes comfort, social interaction, and even quiet study. Their placement was carefully considered to complement nearby areas while giving people a chance to pause and take a break.


Dormitories: The location at the back of the campus enhances security and keeps the dormitories slightly secluded from the public-facing areas. Additionally, the path to the dorms avoids passing by the faculty and classrooms, reducing unnecessary foot traffic and keeping academic areas undisturbed. The dormitories contain a chapel, a study room, a kitchen, water dispensers and showers with both hot and cold water, air-conditioned rooms, and a billiard table. 

Chapel: Setup provides a respectful and inclusive environment for religious reflection and practices. While the design remains modest due to the school’s secular identity, it now offers a neutral, welcoming space for students of various faiths. Its presence acknowledges the spiritual needs of some students without imposing religion on the broader school culture.

Parking (Dorm): A dedicated parking area located near the dormitories for ease of access, especially for students moving in or out. Whether they are returning from weekends at home or packing up for the end of a school year, this lot simplifies the logistics of transporting luggage and supplies. 

Bench (dorm): The dormitory parking includes a waiting area for students to take a break while waiting for friends or rides. It also has a good view with the grandstand, the road, and the basketball court. It's not much but it adds to the comfort and usability of the space. 

Rest area: A rest area open to all students. This area can be flexible — possibly used for lounging, socializing, or studying outdoors. Originally inspired by casual student suggestions, it’s a space open to interpretation and future customization.

Grandstand: It serves as a gathering place for students with a great view of both the field and cafeteria. Whether for sports events, general assemblies, or celebrations, this elevated structure offers seating and visibility for large groups.
 
Kala Lane: These three large gazebos are situated in a quieter area with a scenic view, but still close to the academic zone, despite being a more peaceful alternative to the bustling cafeteria. They provide shaded seating while being more surrounded by the open area,  and closer to nature.

Cafeteria: The cafeteria is centralized to make it the heart of the campus, reflecting its importance as a space where students gather, eat, and unwind. It is large enough to accommodate various vendors and seating preferences. The vendors were chosen considering the large student population and the overall school community. While the seating arrangements include covered, uncovered, and enclosed areas; this flexibility allows students to choose between enjoying the sun, relaxing in the shade, and air-conditioning.

The cafeteria’s design recognizes that food, hydration, and social space are essential to daily school life.


Forest: The forest area is a dedicated quiet zone for students and staff who want to escape the busy school atmosphere. It offers a peaceful environment for solitude, reflection, or even outdoor classes and activities.

Garden: We have added a garden area that provides both beauty and educational value. It can be used for student projects while adding a touch of greenery to the school environment. 



Dropoff area: The dropoff area is designed to protect students from rain and reduce congestion during peak arrival and dismissal times. The layout encourages smoother transitions and offers a safe, spacious waiting zone for cars and students alike. These improvements contribute to the school’s overall traffic management and safety.

Flagpole: As flag ceremonies usually mark the start of the week or special events, having the flagpole in a prominent, accessible location ensures visibility and convenience. It continues to serve as a cultural anchor point for the school community, kept near the entrance for symbolic reasons.

Waiting area: Located just outside the school gate, the waiting area is designed for parents, guardians, and visitors to sit and wait comfortably. It provides seating, shade, and shelter from rain while keeping foot traffic outside the main school grounds. This thoughtful addition improves the experience for families and creates a more organized pickup routine.

Parking (Admin): The parking lot adjacent to the admin building offers direct access for school staff, making daily operations more efficient. It also supports visitor parking when necessary. The proximity to both the admin and the academic zone of buildings makes it a logical, central choice for those who need quick and regular access to school facilities.

Admin building: The admin building remains at the front of the campus because it serves as the main point of contact for visitors, deliveries, and administrative matters. This location supports safety, oversight, and efficiency by keeping key staff close to the entrance. It ensures that external matters can be addressed without disrupting internal academic life.


Pond: While a small pond area was kept in the center as a visual and symbolic centerpiece, creating a sense of tranquility and natural beauty that complements the more structured academic environment.

Overall acads: The overall student activity zone has been placed toward the back of the school for added privacy and security. This section is reserved mainly for enrolled students, though has the capacity to host guests. This layout keeps academic and residential life more protected and uninterrupted. All rooms will be air-conditioned in order to ensure the students and staff will be comfortable.

Library: The library is placed within easy access and includes printers and other such services for student use. Its placement is intentionally removed from noisy zones to maintain the peace and quiet needed for reading and study. It functions as both a resource center and a calm refuge within the academic zone. It will also include rooms that can be availed when needed, such as when preparing for competitions, consulting with a teacher, doing group projects.

Auditorium: A large, air-conditioned auditorium equipped to handle all students and staff for large events, in tandem with smaller auditoriums for smaller activities such as those for single batches. This allows us to be prepared for any combination of events that may happen, ensuring that everyone can have a pleasant viewing experience.

GCU DO Nook: A small cluster of offices and services for other relevant student-related matters. These miscellaneous spaces are grouped together for a clear, accessible hub for student engagement, club management, guidance counseling, and other needs.


Classrooms: The main academic classrooms are centralized into a single building, making scheduling, navigation, and supervision efficient. The wider structure also allows us to enlarge individual classrooms, improving the learning environment and making room for more flexible furniture arrangements. This building includes specialized rooms for the Humanities subjects, including Audio-Visual Rooms (AVR) where students can practice public speaking. 

Bridge: Bridges connecting the upper floors of the classrooms building and the laboratories building to improve accessibility and help keep the flow of foot traffic safe and organized.

Labs building: Dedicated laboratory building offers an unparalleled educational environment equipped with cutting-edge technology, fostering collaboration across various science and technology disciplines. With spacious, safety-focused labs and conference rooms for presentations, students engage in hands-on experimentation in fields like Chemistry, Biology, and Physics while receiving guidance from accessible faculty. This innovative facility is designed to inspire creativity and exploration, ensuring our students are well-prepared for future academic and professional pursuits.
 
At the Philippine Science High School, we pride ourselves on providing an unparalleled educational environment equipped with cutting-edge technology. These have been consolidated into a dedicated building, located next to the classrooms building for easier access.

This dedicated facility fosters collaboration across various science and technology disciplines, allowing for a dynamic and interactive learning experience. Conference rooms available for presentations and science communication, while the teachers’ academic unit facilities are also located here for consultations.

We have spared no expense in creating spacious laboratory rooms that ensure safety is our top priority, while still supporting a wide range of academic pursuits.
